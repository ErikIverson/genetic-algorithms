        <article class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a set of <span class="bolden">n</span> locations, what is the optimal route to visit each just <span class="italy" >once</span> and return to the starting point?

        <h4>Inspiration</h4>
        <article class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Fall semester of 2020, I've grown to become a huge Software Engineering nerd. It began when I took the S.E. course here at Drake University
            and it blew my mind with the seemingly unlimited potential for creating all kinds of applications. I am a hard sciences kind of guy but I 
            also crave an avenue for creativity which made Software Engineering the perfect fit. I had a great experience this past Summer to learn a million more things with 
            a company called IDeaS Revenue Solutions. This internship confirmed for me that I was following my passion so I hope to continue this pursuit with a full time Software Engineering
            role this coming May.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial inspiration for this capstone was based on the branch of artificial intelligence known as Genetic Algorithms. As it alludes to in the name, they 
            are very much developed to mimic the biological evolutionary process. After spending a seriously rivoting semester in CS143 (the AI elective) with Professor Porter, I implored him to let me 
            continue on this exploration - specifically with the unit we left off on last Spring - you guessed it, Genetic Algorithms.

        <h4>Tech Stack & Proof of Concept</h4>
        <article class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Software Engineering lifecycle, one of the first things to do before committing to a large project, is to determine if it's going to be possible to complete it with the available
            resources and knowledge. I spent a lot of time this Summer developing a web application with the popular framework, AngularJS. I figured I'll use that same framework for this project's 
            frontend for the user interface, or UI. This framework runs on three main file types which are TypeScript (basically Javascript with some bonuses), HTML, and CSS. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trickiest part that I had to confirm would be possible before starting, is the Google Maps integration. After some ~googling~, I found
            a few super useful tutorials that demostrated use of an Angular x Google Maps library which makes it much easier to get started with. So I booted up a quick boilerplate Angular App,
            imported this aptly named AGM library to see if indeed it was as simple as it looked. The tutorial required I sign up for a Google Cloud account so I can access their API's which
            allow me to load an interactive map and search for places in the search bar. Using this account, I did generate a small map, drop a few location tags on it, and thus I concluded the Concept
            to have been proven possible.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been snooping around the Google Cloud APIs already, I happened to stumble upon another useful one called 'Distance Matrix' which can be
            fed a list of locations in the world, and will return a matrix of each place's shortest distance in km to each other place. What luck! I did notice though that this was only possible
            via non air travel transportation modes. So a Distance Matrix with New York and London in it would have "Zero Results" as the return value. Oh well, land travel will have to do. 
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the final piece to this puzzle is of course the ACTUAL genetic algorithm that I must write and optimize. It would have been possible I'm sure
            to simply write some functions within TypeScript and run it right there on site, but that's quite lazy and frankly not practical from a Full Stack software perspective. 
            The much more exciting and realistic solution is to use the new age mode of development: a cloud-based microservice approach. This Summer we heavily relied on Amazon Web Services 
            for this type of stuff, but as I mentioned a couple of times I had already found myself deep in the bowels of Google Cloud, so I figured I'll keep with this guy for now. Turns out,
            the Google Functions suite is very similar to AWS Lambda and so it was there that I would host my Python based genetic algorithm code.

        <h4>The Flow of Things</h4>
        <article class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal was to make the main page as intuitive as possible in terms of selecting locations, parameters, and interpreting the results. I am, 
            however, not an experience UX researcher so there may be some flaws. At first the user should recognize the layout as familiar to their standard Google Maps page, with a search bar
            and a "submit" button. You'll notice the green "GO" button is disabled until the user selects at least 3 locations and at most 10 (Google Maps API limit). Once locations are added, 
            the list component shows up on the left hand side, acting as a list and a legend for the place tags that are numbered on the map of listed locations. A user may remove one, or clear 
            all of the locations pretty easily. Once the user has a satisfied list, they are able to get their optimized route by hitting the go button.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's where the behind the scenes magic happens, after a validated submission, the list is parsed and formatted as the input for the Destination
            Matrix API that is publicly available in the Google Cloud. This then immediately returns the so-called "distance-matrix" - a doubly nested list object with each of the n places distances
            from itself to every other place in the list. And of course there will be a sole 0 in each one for mapping the place to itself. We then send this object to my custom function that also
            happens to be hosted in the cloud via another http call. This one takes longer as it runs hundreds of generations with hundreds of dna in each one. But as a return value from this, we
            get the full history of each generation's top performer, or most efficient route. On the screen, it will populate the timeline componenet on the right that displays the best route that
            each generation returned. This then allows for the user to go back in the history of this algorithms evolution to see it progress and get more efficient over time.
